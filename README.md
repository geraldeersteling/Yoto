## Cocoapods

This project uses cocoapods-binary instead of the normal cocoapods procedure. This requires to install the `cocoapods-binary` gem as well (it's in the Gemfile).

**Note:** Currently cocoapods-binary is only working on version 0.4.1 until further notice (see: https://github.com/leavez/cocoapods-binary/issues/136).
If the project fails to build, please remove cocoapods-binary from the Podfile and use cocoapods without.
